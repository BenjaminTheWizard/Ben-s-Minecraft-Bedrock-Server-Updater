Welcome to the Minecraft Bedrock Server Updater

This project, named after its creator, provides a straightforward and efficient way to update a Minecraft Bedrock server in just a few simple steps. Below, you'll find a brief explanation of how it works, as well as important information regarding usage agreements.

Usage Agreement:

Before using this software, please ensure you have read and agreed to the terms and conditions outlined by Microsoft/Mojang on the Bedrock server website.

To update your server:

Visit the official Minecraft Bedrock server download page. At: https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock

Right-click the download button and select "Copy link address."

Paste this link into the software when prompted. This URL is used to download the server’s ZIP file, which my software will automatically uncompress and set up for you.

System requirements:

CPU: Intel Core i3 3210 | AMD A8 7600 APU or equivalent

RAM: 4 GB RAM

HDD: 180 MB to 1 GB available space

Network: Broadband Internet connection

OS: The Linux version of Bedrock Dedicated Server requires Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS version) or later. Other distributions are not supported.

How the Software Works:

This software creates a temporary directory where it downloads and uncompresses the latest Minecraft server files. It’s essential to run the server initially to ensure all files are correctly configured. This step verifies that the directories and files are set up according to the latest standards.

The port number of this software runs on 4131, the port numbers can be changed in the source code. This allows for extra control of which port number of where the update would take place. Please take in note, do not use the same port number running on any connection like a Minecraft Server when this will prevent the update from taking place.

It's strongly advised that the port number that you use isn't accessed by the internet and make sure this port number cannot have access to port fowarding. This port number is strictly for updating the Bedrock Minecraft Server and no connections should be taken place on the server itself.

If by any chance you're receiving errors mention that 'mcserverTemp exists', check in your server directory, remove the directory and try again.

If by any means the code runs into an error due to any other errors. Email me and send me what error you're getting and I'm happy to share solutions to help you.

Important Information:

Open Source: This project is open source, and contributions are welcome.

Caution: While the software includes numerous failsafes to prevent issues, please be cautious when executing the Python script. It should only be used within your Minecraft Bedrock Server directory.

Disclaimer: I have made every effort to ensure this software is robust and safe to use. However, I am not responsible for any damage that may occur due to improper use.

Thank you for using this software, and I hope it makes managing your Minecraft server easier and more efficient.

Have a great day!
